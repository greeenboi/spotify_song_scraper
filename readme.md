# Spotify Playlist Scraper

Basically I got quite vexed with the ads and the missing features `(shuffle & loop)` and overall terrible experience `(ai shuffle)` offered by spotify free plan.
So I made a Quick-Fix to migrate to my own Song Player. `(in Progress)`

## Description

This Project allows you to quickly download all the songs from your Spotify Playlist and save them to your local machine.
It would require you to first sign up for the [Spotify Developer API](https://developer.spotify.com) and get your own `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to use this project.
